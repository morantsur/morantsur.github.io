In the video: [Educating for Excellence](http://www.e4e.org.il/en/) students that participated in the Creative Computing Class visited Google's offices in Tel Aviv.
They met with [Meir Brand](http://www.globes.co.il/en/article-google-israel-ceo-israel-leads-world-in-internet-and-mobile-1000955405), Google Israel CEO and with Google Engineers, and presented their final Scratch projects to them.
The visit got covered by the Kids Channel in Israel, with a short article about the visit
(You can see me give a tour to the kids at 0:30, and the presentations of Scratch projects at 2:12)

Educating for Excellence is an Israeli organisation that operates after-school education centers  for underprivileged youth across the country. Their focus is on giving their students positive learning experiences, and a lot is done to make sure that every lesson plan incorporates a lot of fun and creative activities.

I volunteered with Educating for Excellence in their Jerusalem center as a student, and when I started thinking of ways to extend children’s exposure to Computer Science, it was clear that Educating for Excellence will be a great place to do that in.

I approached them in April 2013, and offered to create a Creative Computing class, based on the [Creative Computing curriculum draft](http://scratched.gse.harvard.edu/resources/scratch-curriculum-guide-draft) by Karen Brannen and her team. They agreed, and I sat off to work and created the curriculum guide attached.

So far, the class has been taught (by me and other instructors) in 8 centers, and it is now offered as part of Educating for Excellence curriculum in all of their centers.
The class ends with a visit to Google’s offices, where the kids present their final projects, and learn about software engineering and technology.
