At the [Lifelong Kindergarten Group](http://media.mit.edu/llk), we believe that people learn best when they are actively engaged in creating projects that are meaningful to them.

As a research assistant in the group, I facilitated over 15 different workshops that engage people with our research group's ideas.
I worked with groups of children, educators, youth counselors and researchers, and ran workshop on different topics related to creative learning, with different tools (Scratch, MaKey MaKey, LEGO WeDo, Paper Electronics and more)

A few example include:

* Teaching Assistant in two Media Lab classes: ["Learning Creative Learning"](http://lcl.media.mit.edu/2016) and "Toys to Think with", Spring, 2016.

* 1-week Learning Creative Learning Workshop with educators in the University of Tsinghua, Beijing, China, Fall, 2016.

* [Get Creative with Coding]("https://dml2016.sched.com/event/7Ekr/get-creative-with-coding-dance-sports-and-other-interests"), Digital Media and Learning Confernce, October 2016.

* Scratch and LEGO WeDo workshop, Sandbox Summit, MIT, April, 2016.

* Scratch and the Physical World, Computer Clubhouse Conference, March, 2016.
