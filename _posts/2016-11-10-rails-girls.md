Rails Girls is a workshop for women, many with no coding experience, where they learn how to build a website using Ruby on Rails and Python in a day.
The workshops take a full day, and expose the participants to the wide range of topics in web development. It is accompanied by talks about technology and a lot of "girl power”.

I volunteered as an instructor in three Rails Girls workshops given in Klarna’s offices in Tel Aviv, as part of the Rails Girls international campaign.
