I desinged a workshop to support new, existing and aspiring leaders of community outreach programs for girls and women in technology field, in their search for a unique, meaningful way to make an impact. I created the workshop, ran it 3 times with ~30 participants, and presented it at the [Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing](http://ghc.anitaborg.org/), 2016.

In this 4 hour workshop participants are exposed to some of the issues programs for girls in technology face through participatory activities, information sessions and discussions. It focuses on the **common challenges** and **common strategies** that programs face, and use the experiences of 14 outreach programs I reviewed in the fall of 2015 as examples. It creates a space for the participants to connect with each other, learn from others and spend some time thinking

The workshop design and the review of common challenges and strategies is available [**here**](http://bit.ly/planning-workshop), and are free to use under the creative commons license.
