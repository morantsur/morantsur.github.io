---

I was a software engineer in the Live Results team for 3 years, and built products that provide direct answers to user queries in variety of domains.

* Worked on various components of the system - back-end, front-end, data ingestion, triggering and integration, as a full-stack developer.
* Designed, implemented and monitored various products, and their integration within Googleâ€™s global infrastructure.
* Collaborated in groups ranging from 4 to 30 teammates to launched more than 10 products in different domains such as sports, translations, and calculators.

Examples:

## Geometry Solver
blog posts on [G+](https://plus.google.com/+google/posts/MLh8RPF5c1t).

Ever had a burning question like ["what is the surface area of a cone with radius 8 and slant height 10?"](https://www.google.com/search?q=what+is+the+surface+area+of+a+cone+with+radius+8+and+slant+height+10+?). Now you can ask your phone to get an answer!

I was part of a small team of engineers working on this feature. We planned, experimented, designed and implemented both the infrastructure and the UI.

More examples:
[volume of a cube](https://www.google.com/search?q=volume+of+a+cube)
[area of a trapezoid](https://www.google.com/search?q=area+of+a+trapezoid)
[what is the width of a rectangle with length 25 inch and area 375 inch](https://www.google.com/search?q=what+is+the+width+of+a+rectangle+with+length+25+inch+and+area+375+inch)

## Translate
An interactive translation onebox, that comes up when you search for [translate](https://www.google.com/search?q=translate), [translate english to polish](https://www.google.com/search?q=translate+english+to+polish) or even [translate education to Japanese](https://www.google.com/search?q=translate+education+to+japanese).
It's interactive and works with voice queries. I worked on the UI of the project.

## Sports
### NBA, NFL, over a 100 soccer leagues, NCAA March Madness, Soccer World Cup, and more
Built product that answer user queries about a team's schedule, scores and standings in the league. We provide answers in many languages, and for local leagues as well as international ones.
I worked on any part of the system - from understanding the user's intent and packaging the right answer to it, through the automatic ingestion of the data feeds from the leagues, to the UI/UX of the final experience.

## London Olympics 2012
My first intern project, responsible for writing the automatic ingestion for data coming for the international olympic committee, mostly for the medal count, results of sports events, and G+ posts.
