In 2014 and 2015, We hosted a Scratch Day event at Google Offices in Tel Aviv.
In partnership with the Ministry of Education, we hosted 150-200 middle school students and teachers every year.

We recruited Google Engineers as volunteers, and they sat with the kids, listened to their project presentations, and gave them feedback.

This has now become a tradition, and Scratch day is celebrated at the offices every year.
