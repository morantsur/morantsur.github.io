As part of the Scratch team I helped launch Scratch Teacher Accounts, a new feature in the [Scratch](http://scratch.mit.edu) online community, which allows teachers to manage their classes on the site - create student accounts, create studios and moderate their students activity.

I conducted a series of interviews with teachers that were alpha testers for the features, to get their feedback and learn about the ways they use Scratch. This helped us prioritize feature requests and create an intro video and FAQ page.

I'm also looking into the usage data collected from students and teachers in the first few months using teacher accounts. Through log analysis, I'm trying to understand if the usage patterns of students is different than that of the general Scratch users population.
