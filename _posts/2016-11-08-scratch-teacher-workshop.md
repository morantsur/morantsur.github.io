At Google, we created a workshop for teachers on teaching in a project based approach, in collaboration with the Computer Science Department of the Ministry of Education. This came as a request from the teachers after we hosted a Scratch Day event where we invited the children to present projects to Google engineers.

The workshop focused on using ideas and processes from the world of software engineering and specifically Google, and adapting them to a classroom setting where students are working with Scratch. This was a participatory workshop, where the teachers experienced the whole process of creating a project themselves.

We covered topics ranging from how to come up with ideas and how to break a big project into smaller steps, through teaching debugging and advanced Scratch tools to How to encourage creativity and collaboration.

25 teachers participated in the first workshop, and each one was to give a workshop to another 10 teachers in their district.
