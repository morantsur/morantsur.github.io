After the great success of the Scratch Day event, we created a workshop for teachers in cooperation with the Computer Science Education Branch of the Ministry of Education.

The workshop focused on taking ideas from Google and the world of software engineering, and finding ways to apply those ideas in a project oriented Scratch class. 
The teachers also went through the process themselves - they thought of ideas, planned their projects, broke it up to a few versions and executed small parts of it. 

25 teachers participated in the first workshop, and each one will now give a workshop to another 10 teachers in their district. 

Topics discussed:

* Ideas

    * Inspiration - where do ideas come from?
    * Google's innovation encouragement techniques - 20%, demo days and more.
    * Hackathon style idea pitching workshop - "the sticky-note" method.
    * How to encourage creativity through exposing to many different examples.

* Planning

    * Versioning - a guiding line in breaking  a big project and divide it to small, meaningful components.
    * "From Many to One" rule of thumb.
    * "My project" worksheet - Help your students plan their projects. 

* Executing

    * Debugging methods.
    * Teaching debugging.
    * Working in a team - the backpack, remixing, using studios, 
    * Advanced Scratch tools - functions, clones.
